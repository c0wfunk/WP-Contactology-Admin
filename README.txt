This Plugin is currently hardcoded to work with the All Star Cheer Sites Network. Change the $user_key and the $client_id in the WP_Cakemail __construct() function

Select Folder to Copy - The folder you are select pulls from the newsletter post type. A folder contains a group of autoresponders, all of which will be copied. 

Select Client to Receive Folder – This is a list of all of the clients we have setup in contactology. Selecting the client will make the next option active once it grabs the data.

Select List to Assign Folder – each autoresponder campaign has to be assigned to a particular mailing list. This displays all of the lists available to the selected client. Choose one.

Press Copy ->  Now wait a bit .. You'll receive a message confirming the process completed.
